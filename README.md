Welcome! My name is Santiago Palavecino and I'm 21 years old. I'm from Buenos Aires. Currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration and Finance.
I have a big interest in becoming a Full Stack Developer. I'm taking my first steps into this world, learning HTML and CSS.

I love learning new things, everyday.
